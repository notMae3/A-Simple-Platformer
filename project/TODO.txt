# update the checkpoint system? use a collision shape to detect passage, then use a marker for spawn point?
	decided to add support for 2 Marker2D nodes, one for min_x value and one for spawn_pos
# setup 'main menu -> game' structure
# make red floor tiles? (would be similar to goal-tiles)
# move level nodes to their own scenes?
# do options menu
# design levels (10? 5?) (just copy paste lvl1 and edit it) (did 4)
# is player hitbox area needed? yes
# add support for 'last level' (count files in res://levels, if current_scene idx+1 == file count: show "Thanks for playing" screen w credits and button to go to start menu)
# add speedrun mode w timer on top of screen (enable/disable in options, have label that tells user about it at MM)
# add death count (togglable in options menu)
# add credit on credits screen?
# limit player movement to edge of screen
# add 'disable checkpoints' option
# change 'speedrun mode' option name to 'track time'
# add some kind of sign at main menu to tell the player they should check out the options
	maybe have the options button bobbing up and down?
	or maybe have it vibrate every 2 sec (rotate it back and forth)
X update the checkpoint system to force the player to be above the Marker2Ds y pos (player.y < marker.y)
# on main menu add keybind 1: start game, 2: options, 3: quit game
X add quit game confirmation dialog
X on respawn "unhold" movement keys to prevent accidental deaths
	difficult


# remember to update the available_levels variable in game.gd
# when finishing up remember to go through laser.gd and move all update shit to _ready (currently its optimized for lvl design)
